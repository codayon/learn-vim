		     Lesson 1.2.5: USING A COUNT TO DELETE MORE


   ** Typing a number with an operator repeats it that many times. **

  In the combination of the delete operator and a motion mentioned above you
  insert a count before the motion to delete more:
	 d   number   motion

  1. Move the cursor to the first UPPER CASE word in the line marked --->.

  2. Type  d2w  to delete the two UPPER CASE words.

  3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with a different count to delete the consecutive
     UPPER CASE words with one command.

--->  this ABC DE line FGHI JK LMN OP of words is Q RS TUV cleaned up.

			 Lesson 1.2.6: OPERATING ON LINES


		   ** Type  dd   to delete a whole line. **

  Due to the frequency of whole line deletion, the designers of Vi decided
  it would be easier to simply type two d's to delete a line.

  1. Move the cursor to the second line in the phrase below.
  2. Type  dd  to delete the line.
  3. Now move to the fourth line.
  4. Type   2dd   to delete two lines.

--->  1)  Roses are red,
--->  2)  Mud is fun,
--->  3)  Violets are blue,
--->  4)  I have a car,
--->  5)  Clocks tell time,
--->  6)  Sugar is sweet
--->  7)  And so are you.

Doubling to operate on a line also works for operators mentioned below.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			 Lesson 1.2.7: THE UNDO COMMAND


   ** Press  u	to undo the last commands,   U  to fix a whole line. **

  1. Move the cursor to the line below marked ---> and place it on the
     first error.
  2. Type  x  to delete the first unwanted character.
  3. Now type  u  to undo the last command executed.
  4. This time fix all the errors on the line using the  x  command.
  5. Now type a capital  U  to return the line to its original state.
  6. Now type  u  a few times to undo the  U  and preceding commands.
  7. Now type CTRL-R (keeping CTRL key pressed while hitting R) a few times
     to redo the commands (undo the undos).

---> Fiix the errors oon thhis line and reeplace them witth undo.

  8. These are very useful commands.  Now move on to the lesson 1.2 Summary.




~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			       Lesson 1.2 SUMMARY

  1. To delete from the cursor up to the next word type:        dw
  2. To delete from the cursor up to the end of the word type:  de
  3. To delete from the cursor to the end of a line type:       d$
  4. To delete a whole line type:                               dd

  5. To repeat a motion prepend it with a number:   2w
  6. The format for a change command is:
               operator   [number]   motion
     where:
       operator - is what to do, such as  d  for delete
       [number] - is an optional count to repeat the motion
       motion   - moves over the text to operate on, such as  w (word),
		  e (end of word),  $ (end of the line), etc.

  7. To move to the start of the line use a zero:  0

  8. To undo previous actions, type:           u  (lowercase u)
     To undo all the changes on a line, type:  U  (capital U)
     To undo the undos, type:                  CTRL-R

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			 Lesson 1.3.1: THE PUT COMMAND


       ** Type	p  to put previously deleted text after the cursor. **

  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.

  2. Type  dd  to delete the line and store it in a Vim register.

  3. Move the cursor to the c) line, ABOVE where the deleted line should go.

		       Lesson 1.3.2: THE REPLACE COMMAND


       ** Type  rx  to replace the character at the cursor with  x . **

  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.

  2. Move the cursor so that it is on top of the first error.

  3. Type   r	and then the character which should be there.

  4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the first line is equal to the second one.

--->  Whan this lime was tuoed in, someone presswd some wrojg keys!
--->  When this line was typed in, someone pressed some wrong keys!

  5. Now move on to lesson 1.3.3.

NOTE: Remember that you should be learning by doing, not memorization.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			Lesson 1.3.3: THE CHANGE OPERATOR


	   ** To change until the end of a word, type  ce . **

  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.

  2. Place the cursor on the  u  in  lubw.

  3. Type  ce  and the correct word (in this case, type  ine ).

  4. Press <ESC> and move to the next character that needs to be changed.

---> This line has a few words that need changing using the change operator.

Notice that  ce  deletes the word and places you in Insert mode.
             cc  does the same for the whole line.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		       Lesson 1.3.4: MORE CHANGES USING c


     ** The change operator is used with the same motions as delete. **

  1. The change operator works in the same way as delete.  The format is:

         c    [number]   motion

  2. The motions are the same, such as   w (word) and  $ (end of line).

  3. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.

  4. Move the cursor to the first error.

  5. Type  c$  and type the rest of the line like the second and press <ESC>.

---> The end of this line needs some help to make it like the second.
---> The end of this line needs to be corrected using the  c$  command.

NOTE:  You can use the Backspace key to correct mistakes while typing.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			       Lesson 1.3 SUMMARY


  1. To put back text that has just been deleted, type   p .  This puts the
     deleted text AFTER the cursor (if a line was deleted it will go on the
     line below the cursor).

  2. To replace the character under the cursor, type   r   and then the
     character you want to have there.

  3. The change operator allows you to change from the cursor to where the
     motion takes you.  eg. Type  ce  to change from the cursor to the end of
     the word,  c$  to change to the end of a line.

  4. The format for change is:

	 c   [number]   motion

Now go on to the next lesson.

		       Lesson 1.7.1: GETTING HELP


		      ** Use the on-line help system **

  Vim has a comprehensive on-line help system.  To get started, try one of
  these three:
	- press the <HELP> key (if you have one)
	- press the <F1> key (if you have one)
	- type   :help <ENTER>

  Read the text in the help window to find out how the help works.
  Type  CTRL-W CTRL-W   to jump from one window to another.
  Type    :q <ENTER>    to close the help window.

  You can find help on just about any subject, by giving an argument to the
  ":help" command.  Try these (don't forget pressing <ENTER>):

	:help w
	:help c_CTRL-D
	:help insert-index
	:help user-manual
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		      Lesson 1.7.2: CREATE A STARTUP SCRIPT


			  ** Enable Vim features **

  Vim has many more features than Vi, but most of them are disabled by
  default.  To start using more features you should create a "vimrc" file.

  1. Start editing the "vimrc" file.  This depends on your system:
	:e ~/.vimrc		for Unix
	:e ~/_vimrc		for Windows

  2. Now read the example "vimrc" file contents:
	:r $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim

  3. Write the file with:
	:w

  The next time you start Vim it will use syntax highlighting.
  You can add all your preferred settings to this "vimrc" file.
  For more information type  :help vimrc-intro

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			     Lesson 1.7.3: COMPLETION


	      ** Command line completion with CTRL-D and <TAB> **

  1. Make sure Vim is not in compatible mode:  :set nocp

  2. Look what files exist in the directory:  :!ls   or  :!dir

  3. Type the start of a command:  :e

  4. Press  CTRL-D  and Vim will show a list of commands that start with "e".

  5. Type  d<TAB>  and Vim will complete the command name to ":edit".

  6. Now add a space and the start of an existing file name:  :edit FIL

  7. Press <TAB>.  Vim will complete the name (if it is unique).

NOTE:  Completion works for many commands.  Just try pressing CTRL-D and
       <TAB>.  It is especially useful for  :help .

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			       Lesson 1.7 SUMMARY


  1. Type  :help  or press <F1> or <HELP>  to open a help window.

  2. Type  :help cmd  to find help on  cmd .

  4. Type  :q  to close the help window.

  5. Create a vimrc startup script to keep your preferred settings.

  6. When typing a  :  command, press CTRL-D to see possible completions.
     Press <TAB> to use one completion.

  This concludes Chapter 1 of the Vim Tutor.  Consider continuing with
  Chapter 2 which covers registers, marks and the use of text objects.

  It was intended to give a brief overview of the Vim editor, just enough to
  allow you to use the editor fairly easily. It is far from complete as Vim
  has many many more commands.

  Read the user manual next: ":help user-manual".

  For further reading and studying, this book is recommended:
	Vim - Vi Improved - by Steve Oualline
	Publisher: New Riders
  The first book completely dedicated to Vim.  Especially useful for beginners.
  There are many examples and pictures.
  See https://iccf-holland.org/click5.html

  This book is older and more about Vi than Vim, but also recommended:
	Learning the Vi Editor - by Linda Lamb
	Publisher: O'Reilly & Associates Inc.
  It is a good book to get to know almost anything you want to do with Vi.
  The sixth edition also includes information on Vim.
